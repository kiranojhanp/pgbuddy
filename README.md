**PGBuddy** is your no-nonsense, tiny sidekick for `postgres.js`. At under 30KB, it's like that friend who shows up with exactly what you need, no extra baggage. Perfect for those "I just want a simple CRUD query" moments.

## Features üåü

- **Type-Safe CRUD Operations**: Fully typed queries with TypeScript for better development experience! üéØ
- **Table-Specific API**: Create dedicated query builders for each table with proper typing! üí™
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Keeps your queries safer than your phone's face ID üîí
- **Lightweight and Minimal**: At under 30KB, it's like a backyard barbie ‚Äì no fancy stuff, just what you need ‚ú®

## Why PGBuddy? üìö

Performing CRUD operations these days is like signing up for a gym membership: you just want to get fit, but suddenly you‚Äôre paying for a personal trainer, a nutritionist, and access to an exclusive yoga studio you‚Äôll never attend. ORMs have somehow turned the simple task of interacting with a database into a venture-funded spectacle. Seriously, some of them have raised millions of dollars to do what SQL already does‚Äîexcept with more steps, less control, and a whole lot of hand-holding. Hats off to the founders, though, for convincing investors that wrapping SQL in 37 layers of abstraction deserves that kind of cash. Meanwhile, all you wanted was to insert a row.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: with that kind of funding, you‚Äôd think these ORMs would also walk your dog, brew your coffee, and maybe write better code for you. But no. Instead, you get a stack trace so long it could wrap around the Earth when something inevitably goes wrong. And what‚Äôs SQL doing during all this chaos? Just sitting there, unbothered, waiting to save you from this madness.

That‚Äôs why articles like [‚ÄúStop Using Knex.js‚Äù](https://gajus.medium.com/stop-using-knex-js-and-earn-30-bf410349856c) by Gajus, the creator of Slonik, resonate with me so much. He argues that SQL query builders are often an anti-pattern. His advice is quite simple: use a query builder only when you actually need to generate dynamic queries, and rely on raw SQL for everything else. SQL is powerful, expressive, and‚Äîwhen used directly‚Äîcuts out the middleman.

This hit home for me because I‚Äôd always wondered why developers seemed allergic to SQL, flocking to ORMs like they were the only way to avoid drowning in database operations. Back when I worked at a remote dev agency, the CTO had a similar view. So, we ditched ORMs like TypeORM and Kysely in favor of Slonik. His argument? The additional abstraction was unnecessary. So, we switched to Slonik, wrote raw SQL for most tasks, and used its type safety and validation to keep things clean. It worked beautifully.

Fast forward to today, and `postgres.js` has become a popular choice in the JavaScript database ecosystem. It‚Äôs fast, lightweight, and functions as both a client and a driver, removing the need for additional dependencies like pg. Its use of JavaScript template literals for writing safe SQL queries feels intuitive and effective. However, as I worked with it, I encountered a familiar challenge: the repetitive nature of writing the same boilerplate CRUD operations for every project.

That‚Äôs where **PGBuddy üê∂** comes in. It‚Äôs designed to streamline these repetitive tasks, providing an efficient way to handle basic CRUD operations while letting developers focus on writing more meaningful and complex SQL queries. It‚Äôs not an attempt to add another heavy layer of abstraction but a small utility aimed at improving developer experience for common operations.

Sure, you might say, ‚ÄúGreat, another abstraction‚Äîjust what we needed.‚Äù Fair enough! Don‚Äôt use it if you don‚Äôt want to. But here‚Äôs the thing: you‚Äôre going to write this functionality eventually. When you find yourself deep in a pile of repetitive CRUD code, just remember that PGBuddy could‚Äôve saved you many hours. And when you finally come around, I‚Äôll be here to welcome you to the club. üòâ

## Installation üöÄ

```bash
npm install postgres@^3.4.5
npm install pgbuddy
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Initial Setup

```typescript
import postgres from "postgres";
import { PgBuddy } from "pgbuddy";

// Define table type
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: string;
}

// Initialize
const sql = postgres({
  host: env.DB_HOST,
  port: env.DB_PORT,
  database: env.DB_NAME,
  username: env.DB_USER,
  password: env.DB_PASSWORD,
});

const db = new PgBuddy(sql);
const userTable = db.table<User>("users");

// Example operations
async function examples() {
  // Select with search and pagination
  const users = await userTable.select({
    select: ["id", "name", "email"],
    search: { columns: ["name", "email"], query: "john" },
    take: 10,
    skip: 0,
    orderBy: [
      { column: "name", direction: "ASC" },
      { column: "email", direction: "DESC" }
    ]
  });

  // Insert with returning values
  const newUser = await userTable.insert({
    data: { name: "John", email: "john@example.com" },
    select: ["id", "name"]
  });

  // Update with conditions
  const updated = await userTable.update({
    data: { role: "admin" },
    where: { id: 1 },
    select: ["id", "name", "role"]
  });

  // Delete with conditions
  const deleted = await userTable.delete({
    where: { role: "guest" },
    select: ["id", "name"]
  });
}
```

### Select Queries

#### Basic Select

```typescript
const users = await userTable.select({
  select: ["id", "name", "email"],  // TypeScript will ensure these columns exist
});
```

#### Search & Pagination

```typescript
const users = await userTable.select({
  select: ["id", "name", "email"],
  search: { columns: ["name", "email"], query: "john" },
  skip: 0,
  take: 10,
});
```

#### Sorting

```typescript
const users = await userTable.select({
  select: ["id", "name"],
  orderBy: [
    { column: "id", direction: "ASC" },
    { column: "name", direction: "DESC" }
  ]
});
```

### Insert Queries

#### Single Record

```typescript
const user = await userTable.insert({
  data: { name: "John", email: "john@example.com" },  // TypeScript validates the shape
  select: ["id", "name", "email"],
});
```

#### Bulk Insert

```typescript
const users = await userTable.insert({
  data: [
    { name: "John", email: "john@example.com" },
    { name: "Jane", email: "jane@example.com" },
  ],
});
```

### Update Queries

#### Update One Record

```typescript
const updated = await userTable.update({
  data: { name: "Updated Name" },
  where: { id: 1 },  // Type-safe conditions
  select: ["id", "name", "email"],
});
```

#### Update Many Records

```typescript
const deactivated = await userTable.update({
  data: { active: false },
  where: { role: "guest" },
  select: ["id", "name"],
});
```

### Delete Queries

#### Delete One Record

```typescript
const deleted = await userTable.delete({
  where: { id: 1 },
  select: ["id", "name"],
});
```

#### Delete Multiple Records

```typescript
const deleted = await userTable.delete({
  where: { status: "inactive" },
  select: ["id", "name"],
});
```
